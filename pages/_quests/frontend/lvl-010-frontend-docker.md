Awesome! You‚Äôve laid a strong foundation by setting up Docker and creating your Jekyll site. Now, let‚Äôs journey further into Level 010, where we will add Bootstrap 5 to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of your site.

### Level 010: Adding Bootstrap 5

#### Step 1: Open Project Directory

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   - **Why It's Important:** This ensures you are working within the correct directory where your Jekyll site files are located.
   - **How to Do It:**
     - Open Terminal.
     - Navigate to your project directory using the command:
       ```sh
       cd my-jekyll-site
       ```
     - **Mystical Insight:** Think of this step as entering your workshop, where all your tools and materials are ready for the next stage of creation.

#### Step 2: Include Bootstrap 5

1. **Create `_includes/head.html` if it doesn‚Äôt exist:**
   - **Why It's Important:** The `_includes/head.html` file is where you can add HTML code that will be included in the `<head>` section of your site's pages. Including Bootstrap here ensures it‚Äôs available site-wide.
   - **How to Do It:**
     - Create the `_includes` directory and the `head.html` file:
       ```sh
       mkdir -p _includes
       touch _includes/head.html
       ```
     - **Mystical Insight:** Imagine crafting a magical charm that will be placed at the top of every page, imbuing each with the power of Bootstrap.

2. **Edit `_includes/head.html` to Include Bootstrap 5:**
   - **Why It's Important:** Adding Bootstrap 5 via a CDN (Content Delivery Network) makes it easy to integrate its powerful CSS and JS framework into your site without manual installation.
   - **How to Do It:**
     - Open `_includes/head.html` in your text editor and add the following code:
       ```html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
       <head>
         <!-- Required meta tags -->
         <meta charset="utf-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

         <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
         <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous">

         <!-- Bootstrap JS and Popper.js -->
         <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
         <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
         <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
       </head>
       </html>
       ```
     - **Explanation of the Code:**
       - `<meta charset="utf-8">`: Sets the character encoding for the document.
       - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">`: Ensures proper scaling and layout on mobile devices.
       - `<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous">`: Includes Bootstrap CSS.
       - `<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`: Includes jQuery, a dependency for Bootstrap's JavaScript.
       - `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`: Includes Popper.js, required for Bootstrap's tooltips and popovers.
       - `<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-xxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`: Includes Bootstrap's JavaScript.

     - **Replace `xxx` with the appropriate integrity values from the Bootstrap CDN site:**
       - You can find these values on the [Bootstrap CDN page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/#cdn-links).

     - **Mystical Insight:** Embedding these scripts and styles is akin to enchanting your pages with Bootstrap‚Äôs spells, granting them enhanced beauty and functionality.

#### Step 3: Modify Your Layout

1. **Customize Your Homepage:**
   - **Why It's Important:** Customizing your homepage with Bootstrap components showcases Bootstrap‚Äôs capabilities and gives your site a professional and polished look.
   - **How to Do It:**
     - Open `index.md` or `index.html` in your text editor.
     - Replace its content with the following HTML code that uses Bootstrap components:
       ```html
       ---
       layout: default
       title: Home
       ---

       <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
         <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
         <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
           <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
         </button>
         <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
           <ul class="navbar-nav">
             <li class="nav-item active">
               <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
             </li>
             <li class="nav-item">
               <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
             </li>
             <li class="nav-item">
               <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
             </li>
             <li class="nav-item">
               <a class="nav-link disabled" href="#">Disabled</a>
             </li>
           </ul>
         </div>
       </nav>
       <div class="container">
         <div class="jumbotron">
           <h1 class="display-4">Hello, world!</h1>
           <p class="lead">This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content or information.</p>
           <hr class="my-4">
           <p>It uses utility classes for typography and spacing to space content out within the larger container.</p>
           <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#" role="button">Learn more</a>
         </div>
       </div>
       ```
     - **Mystical Insight:** Think of this step as decorating your enchanted clearing with beautiful artifacts. Each Bootstrap component adds a touch of elegance and utility to your site.
